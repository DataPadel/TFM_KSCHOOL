    "Platforms like Hugging Face provide access to pre-trained vision models (e.g., ResNet, Vision Transformers, CLIP). These models can extract embeddings (numerical representations) from images, capturing features like posture, swing style, or environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "  - CLIP*: Combines image and text understanding, enabling semantic embeddings.\n",
    "  - *ResNet/VGG**: Traditional deep learning models for visual feature extraction.\n",
    "  - Vision Transformers (ViT): State-of-the-art models for capturing global image features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Steps**:\n",
    "  1. **Select a Pre-trained Model**: Look for models fine-tuned on sports or action datasets if possible.\n",
    "  2. **Generate Embeddings**:\n",
    "     - Pass client-uploaded images through the pre-trained model to extract embeddings.\n",
    "     - Store these embeddings for downstream tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are Embeddings?**\n",
    "- **Embeddings** are numerical representations of data, such as text, images, or audio, in a high-dimensional vector space.\n",
    "- For images, embeddings capture the visual features of an image (e.g., shapes, colors, patterns, and relationships between objects). These features are encoded as a vector of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an embedding as a \"compressed summary\" of an image that allows a machine learning model to understand and compare images.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Use Image Embeddings in Your Case**\n",
    "You want to recommend padel rackets based on client-uploaded photos of them playing. The key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Extracting Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Use a pre-trained image model (like CLIP or ResNet) to process the uploaded photo.\n",
    "   - The model analyzes the image and outputs a vector of numbers (the embedding) that represents the player's style, posture, environment, or other visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Input: An image of a person playing padel.\n",
    "   - Output: A vector like `[0.23, -0.87, 1.56, ..., -0.45]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Comparing Embeddings**\n",
    "   - Embeddings allow you to measure the similarity between images.\n",
    "   - If two images have similar embeddings, they represent similar visual styles or patterns.\n",
    "   - You can use metrics like **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance** to compare embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Player's image embedding: `[0.23, -0.87, 1.56, ..., -0.45]`\n",
    "   - Another player's embedding: `[0.25, -0.85, 1.53, ..., -0.48]`\n",
    "   - The two embeddings are similar, so their playing styles might be alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Mapping Embeddings to Rackets**\n",
    "   - Use a dataset of pre-labeled images of players with their preferred rackets (or approximate recommendations based on features like weight, balance, etc.).\n",
    "   - Cluster embeddings of these reference images and associate each cluster with a type of racket.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   - Cluster A (lightweight rackets): Embeddings of players with a defensive playing style.\n",
    "   - Cluster B (balanced rackets): Embeddings of players with an all-around style.\n",
    "   - Cluster C (power rackets): Embeddings of players with aggressive play.\n",
    "\n",
    "   When a new player uploads an image:\n",
    "   - Extract their embedding.\n",
    "   - Find the closest cluster of reference embeddings.\n",
    "   - Recommend rackets associated with that cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Pre-trained Models**\n",
    "   - Use pre-trained models like **CLIP** or **ResNet** for embedding extraction.\n",
    "   - These models already understand visual features well and donâ€™t require training from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How It All Fits Together**\n",
    "1. **Client Uploads Image**:\n",
    "   - A player uploads a photo of them playing padel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extract Embedding**:\n",
    "   - Pass the image through a pre-trained model to extract the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Find Similar Styles**:\n",
    "   - Compare the embedding to existing embeddings in your database.\n",
    "   - Identify the closest matches (similar playing styles).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Recommend a Racket**:\n",
    "   - Based on the matched style, recommend a racket (e.g., lightweight for defensive, power-oriented for aggressive).\n",
